Cosmic-Ray-Simulator
====================

This code simulates an experimental setup that aims to measure the lifetime of the muon.


This cosmic Ray physics simulator:
  
  1. Simulates the flux of muons crossing the detector
  
  2. Develop methods to estimate the energy loss of the particles crossing the materials, due to physical phenomena like Cerenkov radiation or Scintillation emission
  
  3. Simulate the propagation of the muon through the detector ( Scintillators and Water Tank)
  
  4. Create methods that simulate the creation and propagation of secondary particles produced by the interaction of the muon with matter
  
  5. Create a graphical user interface
  
  6. Make a scalable and modular simulator that can be easily integrable with other simulators, using the Classes framework of C++ and ROOT
